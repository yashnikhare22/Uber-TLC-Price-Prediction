# Data Analytics Project: ETL Pipeline, Hyperparameter Tuning, and Data Visualization

## Overview

Welcome to our Data Analytics project repository! This project encompasses three key aspects of data analysis:

1. **ETL Data Pipeline:** I designed a star schema and utilized AWS Glue to construct an ETL data pipeline for a dataset. Leveraging SQL queries on Amazon Athena, we extracted valuable insights from this data, making it ready for analysis.

2. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** In machine learning, hyperparameter tuning is crucial for model performance. We've fine-tuned GBR (Gradient Boosting Regressor) hyperparameters using Grid Search, achieving an impressive Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (MSLE) of 0.52 and an R-squared (r2) value of 0.73 on the test dataset.

3. **Data Visualization:** Data comes to life through visualization. I've developed interactive Tableau dashboards to enhance data visualization and analysis capabilities, allowing users to explore and understand the data more effectively.


Before you start, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Python 3.x
- An AWS Account
- Tableau Desktop

## Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Follow the installation instructions above.

2. Navigate to the `ETL_Pipeline` directory for details on the ETL data pipeline.

3. Explore the `Hyperparameter_Tuning` directory to understand how we fine-tuned the model.

4. Check out the `Data_Visualization` directory to view and interact with our Tableau dashboards.

## ETL Data Pipeline

Our ETL data pipeline involves the following steps:

1. **Schema Design:** We designed a star schema to structure our data efficiently for analysis.

2. **AWS Glue:** We utilized AWS Glue to build the ETL pipeline, making it easier to extract, transform, and load data.

3. **SQL Queries on Athena:** SQL queries on Amazon Athena were used to extract valuable insights from the transformed data.

## Hyperparameter Tuning

In our machine learning process, we performed hyperparameter tuning for the Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBR) model. We used Grid Search to find the optimal hyperparameters. The results were outstanding, with an MSLE of 0.52 and an r2 score of 0.73 on the test dataset.

## Data Visualization

Data visualization is key to understanding complex datasets. We've created interactive Tableau dashboards that allow you to explore and analyze the data visually. These dashboards provide an intuitive way to gain insights from our dataset.
